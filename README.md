drawable-resizer
================

Simple Ruby/ImageMagick script to resize high-resolution Android drawable assets to lower resolutions.

## How to

1. Make sure you have ruby running.
2. Install [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) (I highly recommend using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) for that.
3. Clone the repo.
4. `cd` into your `res` directory (the one that contains drawable-hdpi).
5. Run `ruby resizer.rb` and let it do its thing. Read the output, it can be helpful.

## Never forget

Some assets simply have to be generated by hand, especially thin lines.
